## Fine-tuning a Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) model for text classification with TensorFlow. 


This is a  project on fine-tuning a <b> Bidirectional Transformers  for Language Understanding (BERT) </b> model for text classification with TensorFlow. <br>

In this project, I walk through  preprocess and tokenize data for BERT classification,<br>
build TensorFlow input pipelines for text data with the tf.data API,<br>
and train and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub.
